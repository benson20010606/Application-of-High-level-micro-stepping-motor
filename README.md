# Application of High-level micro-stepping motor
## Important matters
**This project was jointly completed by @benson20010606 and  Zhiqiang Wang**  
**The controller program is modified based on the STMicroelectronics sample program.**

## Inintroduce
    This research project uses the STM32F401RE development board, the IHM02A1 motor driver board, and C# as the development platform. The program is flashed onto the STM32F401RE and an operation interface is written in C# to achieve Human-Machine Interface (HMI) implementation. The operation interface allows control of the stepper motor. The actions controlled by the user are encoded and transmitted to the STM32F401RE via UART. The development board then decodes the commands and issues them to the driver board via SPI, enabling multi-axis stepper motor control.  

## HARDWARE
### STM32 F401RE
Equipped with mbed functionality and supporting Arduino interfaces, it also provides ST Morpho extension headers, which can connect to all peripheral external devices of the microcontroller. The Arduino connectivity enables this development board to utilize Arduino expansion features, allowing developers to easily and quickly add special functionalities. This development board also provides comprehensive support for the STM32 series, enabling developers to flexibly prototype designs and dynamically fine-tune software and hardware at various stages of development. The development board integrates ease of use, flexibility, connectivity, and mainstream tool resources, making it one of the ideal development boards for developers.

### STM32 F401RCT6 CORE BOARD
Compared to the STM32F401RE, which uses the same MCU and functionalities, the flashing method for this board utilizes JTAG. Although this flashing method is more complex than that of the STM32F401RE, it offers the advantage of a smaller size, making it more suitable for system integration and reducing the space required.

### X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1
The X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 is a two axis stepper motor driver expansion board based on the L6470. It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for low voltage motor control driving for stepper motors in your STM32 Nucleo project.  

The L6470PD is the main driver chip for the two-axis driver board x-nucleo-ihm02a1. Its primary function is to send pulse signals to control stepper motors. This chip provides an operating voltage of 8-45V, 128 microstep capability, step loss detection, programmable speed profiles, and positioning capability. It also features an SPI module, good power efficiency, and over-temperature protection. Paired with the STM32F401RE development board, it can control up to 8 stepper motors, making it suitable for various applications in multi-axis motor control development.
### optical interrupter
An optical interrupter is a type of sensor with internal components that include an emitter and a receiver placed opposite each other within the same package. When an object passes through the optical interrupter, it interrupts the light path between the emitter and the receiver. If the receiver detects light, it triggers a transistor to maintain a stable state; when no light is detected, it generates a signal. This method is used to achieve the detection function of the optical interrupter.  

In this project, the signal generated by the optical interrupter is used to detect whether a motor exceeds its working range. If the detection point triggers the optical interrupter, the STM32F401RE development board immediately receives the signal and stops the stepper motor from continuing to move.  
### optocoupler
An optocoupler is a device that uses light (including visible light and infrared) as a medium to transmit electrical signals between input and output circuits. Its function is to normally isolate the input circuit from the output circuit, and to allow electrical signals to pass through the isolation layer when needed. Optocouplers enable signal transmission between two electrically isolated circuits, ensuring that high voltages between these circuits do not affect each other.  

In this project, the ILQ620GB optocoupler is used as an isolation for limit switch signals. It features 4 sets of optically isolated switches designed for electrical isolation. Its primary function is to block high voltages and voltage transients, preventing these transient voltages from affecting other parts of the circuit.  

### Stepper motor
A stepper motor is a type of brushless DC electric motor characterized by a stator and rotor with teeth-like projections that interlock. It rotates in discrete steps by switching the direction of current in the stator coils. Stepper motors operate using open-loop control and are triggered by pulse signals to switch currents. They do not require feedback devices for position or speed detection. This allows stepper motors to rotate precisely in proportion to the pulse signals, achieving accurate position and speed control with high stability.
